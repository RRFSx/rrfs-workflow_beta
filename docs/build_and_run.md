# 1. Build
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:rrfs2/rrfs-workflow.git`

`cd sorc` and run the following command to build the system. This will take a very long time at the moment:    
`build.all`

or you may open 3 terminals, with each terminal running one of the following commands:  

```
./build.wps  | tee ./log.build.wps
./build.mpas | tee ./log.build.mpas
./build.rdas | tee ./log.build.rdas

```

# 2. Setup and run experiments:
### 2.1. copy and modify exp.setup
```
cd workflow
cp exp/exp.setup .
vi exp.setup
```
In retro runs, for simplicity, `OPSROOT` provides a top directory for `COMROOT`, `DATAROOT` and `EXPDIR`. But this is NOT a must and you may set them separately without a shared top directory.
    
Users don't set `EXPDIR` directly. `setup_exp.py` will set it automatically following this rule: `EXP_BASEDIR/VERSION/EXP_NAME`.     
   
Set `REALTIME=false`, a corresponding `RETRO_PERIOD`, and then `setup_exp.py` will automatically set up `CYCLEDEF_*` variables and write them into the exp.setup file under `EXPDIR`  
`RETRO_CYCLETHROTTLE` and `RETRO_TASKTHROTTLE` can be modified as needed.

Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/rrfs2/rrfs-workflow/wiki/deploy-a-Jet-realtime-run-in-Jet) for setting up realtime runs. Note: realtime runs under role accounts should be coordinated with the POC of each realtime run.

### 2.2 setup_exp.py
`./setup_exp.py`   
    
This Python script creates an experiment directory (i.e. `EXPDIR`), defines `CYCLEDEF_*` variables smartly, writes out a final copy of `exp.setup`, and  then copies all config files from `HOMErrfs` to `EXPDIR`.
    
After that, it will ask `Do you want to create an xml file right now(y/n):`      
    
In many situations, please answer `n` so that you get a chance to modify config files further to meet the needs of a target experiment.      

### 2.3 setup_xml.py
`./setup_xml.py EXPDIR`    
replace `EXPDIR` with the actual path printed out in step 2.2
    
It creates an `rrfs.xml` file based on `exp.setup` and config files.   
    
The workflow uses a cascade config structure to separate concerns so that a task/job/application/function_group only defines required environmental variables in runtime. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/rrfs2/rrfs-workflow/wiki/The-cascade-config-structure) for more information.

### 2.4 run and monitor experiments using rocoto commands

Go to `EXPDIR`, and open `rrfs.xml` to make sure it has all required tasks and settings.
    
Use `./run_rocoto.sh` to run the experiment. Add an entry to your crontab similar as follows to run the experiment continuously.
```
*/5 * * * * /home/role.rtrr/RRFS/1.0.1/conus3km/run_rocoto.sh
```
Check the first few tasks/cycles to make sure everything works well.

### note
The workflow depends on the environmental variables. If your environment defines and exports rrfs-workflow-specific environmental variables in an unexpected way or your environment is corrupt, the setup step may fail or generate unexpected results. Check the `rrfs.xml` file before `run_rocoto.sh`. Starting from a fresh terminal or `module purge` usually solves the problem.
