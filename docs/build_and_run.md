# 1. Build
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:rrfs2/rrfs-workflow.git`

`cd sorc` and run the following command to build the system. This will take a very long time at the moment:    
```
build.all
```

or you may open 3 terminals, with each terminal running one of the following commands:  

```
./build.wps  | tee ./log.build.wps
./build.mpas | tee ./log.build.mpas
./build.rdas | tee ./log.build.rdas

```

# 2. Setup and run experiments:
### 2.1. copy and modify exp.setup
```
cd workflow
cp exp/exp.setup .
vi exp.setup
```
In retro runs, for simplicity, `OPSROOT` provides a top directory for `COMROOT`, `DATAROOT` and `EXP_BASEDIR`. But this is NOT a must and you may set them separately without a shared top directory.
    
Users don't set `EXPDIR` directly. `setup_exp.py` will set it automatically following this rule: `EXP_BASEDIR/VERSION/EXP_NAME`.     
   
`setup_exp.py` will smartly computes CYCLEDEFS based on the `REALTIME`, `REALTIME_DAYS`, `RETRO_PERIOD` settings.  
`RETRO_CYCLETHROTTLE` and `RETRO_TASKTHROTTLE` can be modified as needed.

Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/rrfs2/rrfs-workflow/wiki/deploy-a-Jet-realtime-run-in-Jet) for setting up realtime runs. Note: realtime runs under role accounts should be coordinated with the POC of each realtime run.

### 2.2 setup_exp.py
```
./setup_exp.py
```   
    
This Python script creates an experiment directory (i.e. `EXPDIR`), writes out a runtime version of `exp.setup` under EXPDIR, and  then copies runtime config files from `HOMErrfs` to `EXPDIR`.
       
Users usually need to set up `ACCOUT`, `QUEUE`, `PARTITION`, or `RESERVATION` by modifying `config/resources/config.${machine}` or you may export those variables in the current environment before running setp_exp.py, or export those variables in `exp.setup`.  
    
The workflow uses a cascade config structure to separate concerns so that a task/job/application/function_group only defines relevant environmental variables required in runtime. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/rrfs2/rrfs-workflow/wiki/The-cascade-config-structure) for more information.

### 2.3 run and monitor experiments using rocoto commands

Go to `EXPDIR`, open `rrfs.xml`, and make sure it has all the required tasks and settings.
    
Use `./run_rocoto.sh` to run the experiment. Add an entry to your crontab similar to the following to run the experiment continuously.
```
*/5 * * * * /home/role.rtrr/RRFS/1.0.1/conus3km/run_rocoto.sh
```
Check the first few tasks/cycles to make sure everything works well. You may use [this handy rocoto tool](https://github.com/rrfs2/qrocoto/wiki/qrocoto) to check the workflow running status.

### note
The workflow depends on the environmental variables. If your environment defines and exports rrfs-workflow-specific environmental variables in an unexpected way or your environment is corrupt, the setup step may fail or generate unexpected results. Check the `rrfs.xml` file before `run_rocoto.sh`. Starting from a fresh terminal or `module purge` usually solves the above problem.
